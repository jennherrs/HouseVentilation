Whole House Ventilation System
The Whole House Ventilation System is designed to monitor the indoor air quality within an entire house. Using sensors, it checks that the concentrations in the air of water vapor, total volatile organic compounds, and carbon dioxide gas are within safe levels. If either of these substances exceed safe levels, the system will automatically start a fan to draw out the contaminated air. What distinguishes this project from its competitors is its affordability and the ease with which the air quality information is displayed.Â
